## What is React.js?

A JavaScript library for building user interfaces - Great for client side developement - Needs other frameworks for full application

## Key Features

Server Side Rendering SSR

- Code is rendered on the servers end
- SSR makes SEO better and no loading screen
- After the initial load you get a standard React app

File Based Routing - Normally we use react.router to give the simulation of page navigation in react but with sending extra requests to the server, typically - In Next.js we define pages and routes with files and folders instead of code!!! - in the PAGES folder is where you put the pages - LESS CODE, LESS WORK, HIGHLY UNDERSTANDABLE

Fullstack Capabilities - Easily add backend (server-side) code to your Next & React apps - Storing data, getting data, authentication can be added to your React projects
